# RKN-for-uBO
uBlock Origin [and other compatible apps] filter based on the RKN (The Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media) registry.

Notes:
1. Only those domains, that are blocked entirely, are included.
2. All IP addresses were deleted.
3. Dead unresolvable domain names, some parked and non-functioning domains were deleted, too. 
4. The records by The Federal Tax Service, that block illegal gambling, were also excluded.
5. Some domains with non-standard low-level names may be missing, too.
